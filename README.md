## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
	* Vehicle Length and Vehicle Ground Clearance are statistically significant with a p-value = 0.00000000000260 and p-value =  0.0000000521 respectively. This indicates these two factors have a significant influence on the MechaCar gas mileage. While Spoiler Angle, Vehicle Weight, and AWD have p-values that are greater than the .05 threshold for significance. 

	* The slope of this model would not be considered zero. The overall p-value = 0.0000000521 for the model, we are able to reject the null hypothesis and demonstrate the slope would not be considerd 0. 

	* This model is able to predict the gas mileage of MechaCar prototypes relatively effectively. Our R-Squared value = .7149 which roughly computes to 71% of predictions. This would account for a large majority of mpg estimates. 

## Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
	* The Total Summary for the production lot has a variance of 62.29, which does meet the design specifications. Lot 1 and Lot 2 do appear to meet the design specification for their respective manufacturing lots. Lot 1 has a variance of approximately .98, Lot 2 has variance of approximately 7.47. However, Lot 3 has a variance of 170.29 - this greatly exceeds the design specifications. Lot 3 appears to be problematic and will need further investigation.
